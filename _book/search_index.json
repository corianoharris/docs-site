It guides teams to focus on understanding and solving user problems, defining a clear vision, and delivering measurable outcomes. This method helps ensure that a product aligns with user needs and drives business goals.\nKey Components of Product Thinking\n1. User First\nUnderstanding the user's needs and challenges is the foundation of product thinking. Before jumping into development, a deep understanding of the problem and the target audience is essential.\n\nProblems: What problem are we solving?\n\nIdentify the core problems that the product aims to address. This helps align the team's efforts toward delivering real value to users.\n\n\nTarget Audience: For whom are we doing this?\n\nDefine the specific audience segments that will benefit from the solution. Knowing who the product is for allows for tailored features and messaging.\n\n\n\nProblem-Solution Fit\nOnce the problem and audience are clearly defined, it's crucial to validate that the solution effectively addresses these issues. This step helps to ensure that the product will genuinely meet user needs.\n2. Job-To-Be-Done\nWith a clear understanding of the user's needs, the next step is to define the product’s purpose and strategy.\n\nVision: Why are we doing this?\n\nEstablish a vision that explains the purpose behind the product. This serves as a guiding principle, aligning all stakeholders around a shared objective.\n\n\nStrategy: How are we doing this?\n\nDevelop a strategy outlining the approach to achieve the vision.

This document outlines governance, token naming conventions, Figma file organization, component naming structure, and a playground environment to test and iterate on components.\n1. Design System Governance\nDesign System Governance defines the guidelines, processes, and ownership structure for maintaining and updating the design system. Effective governance ensures the system evolves sustainably, aligns with brand and user experience goals, and remains accessible to all team members.\nKey Responsibilities\n\nOwnership: Identify key team members or a Design System Governance Board responsible for system maintenance and evolution.\nVersioning: Track changes and version updates to ensure smooth integration across projects. Use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.2.0).\nContribution Process: Define a clear process for proposing, reviewing, and approving new components or updates.\nDocumentation Standards: Ensure thorough documentation of components, tokens, usage guidelines, and accessibility standards.\nCommunication: Schedule regular check-ins with stakeholders to review updates and gather feedback.\n\n2. Tokens - Primitive and Semantic Naming\nDesign tokens are the foundational elements that drive visual consistency across components and themes. Proper naming conventions help differentiate between the types of tokens and their use cases.\nPrimitive Tokens\nPrimitive tokens define the basic values such as colors, typography, spacing, and border radii. These are usually immutable constants that should not be altered within the design system.\nExamples\n\ncolor-blue-500\nfont-size-16\nspacing-8\n\nSemantic Tokens\nSemantic tokens provide meaning by mapping primitive tokens to specific design contexts. They allow for easier re-theming and adaptation of the design system across different brands or contexts.\nExamples\n\ncolor-primary → mapped to color-blue-500\nfont-body → mapped to font-size-16\nspacing-card-padding → mapped to spacing-8\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nPrimitives: Use descriptive names with numerical values indicating intensity (e.g., color-gray-700).\nSemantics: Use purpose-driven names based on context (e.g., color-alert, spacing-content-padding).\n\n3. Figma File Structure\nA well-organized Figma file structure enhances collaboration and ensures consistency across the design team.\nRecommended Figma File Organization\n\n1. FoundationContains design tokens such as colors, typography, and grid systems.\n\n2. ComponentsHolds individual components, each named according to their function (e.g., Button, Card, Input Field). Components should be organized into folders based on UI patterns (e.g., Forms, Navigation).\n\n3. PatternsContains collections of components in common patterns (e.g., Login Form, Navbar). Patterns demonstrate real-world use cases for components.\n\n4. TemplatesPage layouts showcasing how components and patterns work together in various page structures.\n\n5. PlaygroundA sandbox area where designers can experiment and test new components before integrating them into the main system.\n\n\nFigma File Naming Conventions\n\nComponent File: Component-[Component Name] (e.g., Component-Button)\nPattern File: Pattern-[Pattern Name] (e.g., Pattern-Login)\nTemplate File: Template-[Template Name] (e.g., Template-Homepage)\n\n4. Components Naming and Structure\nComponent naming and structure play a crucial role in maintaining organization and consistency. Components should be named according to their role and functionality, enabling easy searching and reusability.\nNaming Conventions\n\nAtomic Components: Use singular names for basic components (e.g., Button, Input).\nMolecular Components: Combine atomic components to form a unit with a specific purpose (e.g., Card, ModalHeader).\nOrganisms: Use descriptive names that convey purpose and function (e.g., LoginForm, ProductList).\n\nComponent Structure in Code\nOrganize components in a folder-based hierarchy to separate logic, styling, and tests.\nExample folder structure:\nButton/\n├── Button.js     # Component logic\n├── Button.css    # Component styles\n└── Button.test.js # Component tests\nFigma Component Structure\n\nVariants: Utilize variants in Figma to handle different states (e.g., Primary, Secondary, Disabled for Buttons).\nAuto Layout: Use Figma's Auto Layout for responsive and adaptable component design.\n\n5. Playground\nThe Playground is an essential part of the design system where designers and developers can experiment with new components, patterns, and layouts without impacting the main system. This sandbox environment encourages testing, iteration, and validation before full integration.\nPlayground Guidelines\n\nTesting New Components: Try out new components and patterns, adjust styling, and gather feedback.\nResponsive Testing: Experiment with component behaviors across different screen sizes and breakpoints.\nTheme Variations: Test components with different themes and semantic tokens to ensure adaptability.\n\n\nBy following these guidelines, teams can create a robust and scalable design system that enhances collaboration, maintains brand consistency, and improves user experiences across projects.\n"},"docs/TechRole/UX/practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UX/practices.html","title":"UX","keywords":"","body":"Practices\nUX best practices to keep in mind:\n\nUser-Centered Design: Focus on the user's needs and goals, and design the interface and interactions to meet those needs.\n\nClear and Simple Navigation: Provide clear and easy-to-use navigation that allows users to find what they need quickly and easily.\n\nConsistency: Use consistent design patterns and elements throughout the interface to create a sense of familiarity and predictability for users.\n\nBrand and Voice: Understand the brand and communicate the appropriate tone.\n\nAccessibility: Ensure that the interface is accessible to users with disabilities and meets accessibility guidelines.\n\nPerformance: Optimize the performance of the interface to ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions.\n\nFeedback and Notifications: Provide clear and timely feedback to users to confirm actions, inform them of errors, and provide updates on their progress.\n\nMobile Optimization: Design the interface to be responsive and optimized for mobile devices.\n\nUser Testing: Regularly test the interface with real users to identify issues and areas for improvement.\n\nData-Driven Design: Use data and analytics to inform design decisions and improve the user experience.\n\nContinuous Improvement: Adopt a mindset of continuous improvement and iterate on the design based on user feedback and data analysis.\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/UX/research-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UX/research-practices.html","title":"Research Practices","keywords":"","body":"UX Research Practices\nHere are some UX research best practices to keep in mind:\n\nSet Clear Goals: Define the research goals and objectives upfront and align them with the business goals to ensure that the research is focused and actionable.\n\nChoose the Right Research Method: Select the appropriate research method(s) based on the research goals and the type of information needed.

Let's say we want to create an app to help people manage their daily tasks more effectively. We noticed that many people struggle to keep track of their tasks, leading to missed deadlines and increased stress levels. Our app will aim to solve this problem by providing users with a simple and efficient way to manage their tasks.\nStep 2: Defining the scope\nOnce we've identified the problem, we need to define the scope of the project. This involves deciding what features the app will have, what platforms it will be available on, and what audience it will target. For this project, we'll focus on creating an iOS app that targets busy professionals.\nStep 3: Conducting research\nBefore we start designing the app, we need to conduct research to gain a deeper understanding of our target audience and their needs. This will involve:\nSurveys: We'll create a survey to gather information about our target audience's current task management methods, pain points, and preferences.\nUser interviews: We'll conduct user interviews to gain a better understanding of our target audience's needs and challenges when it comes to task management.\nCompetitor analysis: We'll research other task management apps on the market to see what features they offer and how they are designed.\nStep 4: Creating user personas\nBased on our research, we'll create user personas to represent our target audience. These personas will help us keep the needs of our target audience in mind throughout the design process.\nStep 5: Creating user stories\nNext, we'll create user stories to describe how our personas will use the app. These stories will help us design the app's features and user interface to meet the needs of our target audience.\nStep 6: Creating wireframes\nUsing our user stories as a guide, we'll create wireframes to design the app's interface. Wireframes are simple sketches that show the layout of the app's screens and the placement of its elements.\nStep 7: Creating mockups\nAfter we've finalized the wireframes, we'll create mockups of the app's screens. Mockups are high-fidelity designs that show what the app will look like when it's complete. We'll use these mockups to test the app's usability and get feedback from users.\nStep 8: Testing and iterating\nFinally, we'll test the app's usability with our target audience and iterate based on their feedback. We'll continue to test and iterate until we have a final design that meets the needs of our target audience.\nIn conclusion, this is a high-level overview of the process of designing a UX project for a fictitious app. The process may vary depending on the project scope and the team's approach, but it generally involves identifying the problem, conducting research, creating user personas and stories, creating wireframes and mockups, and testing and iterating.\n"},"docs/TechRole/UX/ux-stages.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UX/ux-stages.html","title":"UX Stages","keywords":"","body":"The UX (User Experience) Stages\nThe UX (User Experience) stages typically include:\n\nUser Research: This stage involves gathering information about the target users, their goals, needs, behaviors, and pain points.\n\nInformation Architecture: This stage involves organizing the information and content in a clear and logical manner, based on the insights gained from the user research.\n\nInteraction Design: This stage involves designing the interactions between the user and the interface, such as the navigation, buttons, and menus, to create a seamless and intuitive user experience.\n\nVisual Design: This stage involves creating the visual elements of the interface, such as color schemes, typography, and graphic design, to create an aesthetically pleasing and consistent design.\n\nPrototyping: This stage involves creating a prototype or mockup of the design to test and validate the design with users, and to identify any issues or areas for improvement.\n\nUser Testing: This stage involves testing the prototype with real users to gather feedback, insights, and data on the usability and effectiveness of the design.\n\nImplementation: This stage involves implementing the final design into the product or service, and ensuring that it meets the user's needs and expectations.\n\nQuality Assurance or UX Audit: This stage involves reviewing new releases.

And let’s be honest, the end-user may not use 90% of your app’s buttons that often, so there is no need to overwhelm them\n\nPrioritize Visual Proximity: Buttons should be close to the data that they influence. This means that when you have fewer buttons on one screen, you gain visual proximity.\n\nRemember, Users Do Not Hate Scrolling!: Placing more information higher on the page does not mean the end-user will necessarily absorb that information. It may make them tire of your app more quickly and even leave.\n\n\n\nDo Not Put Everything in Drop-Down Menus:\n\nEmphasize Balance: Think about your interface as a physical space.\n\n\nLet the User Know Where They Are in the App: When your app has a consistent design system and brand style, all the pages may start to feel the same to the end-user.\n\nDesign for Distracted Users: The last thing on their mind is what link they just clicked and where they are in the flow of your app.\n\n\nAvoid Long Lines and Tiny Text: The rule of thumb for web typography is to write no more than nine words per line. When the end-user is finished reading a line, their eyes need to be able to find the next line. So, if a line is too long, it is harder for their eyes to move on.\n\nWhitespace Is Not Wasted Space: Do Not Double Up the Pop-Ups\n\n\nDo Not Double Up the Pop-Ups: The end-user will lose the mental model of where they are in the flow of app pages or the process. They will be more distracted, no matter if they close the second pop-up window and return to the first pop-up window or return to the original screen\n\nAvoid One Too Many Pop-Up Windows: Avoid One Too Many Pop-Up Windows: Turn the first pop-up window into a page itself, or convert the second pop-up window into an inline message in the first pop-up window\n\n\nLay Your Cards on the Table: When you nest a card inside another card, the end-user’s mental model of what you can do with the cards starts to break down. This end-user may even start to question the relationships of other objects in the UI, thus further compromising the design hierarchy in your app.\n\nDo Not Nest Card: Place them next to each other.\n\n\nPlan Your Forms Carefully: How many form fields are visible on the screen at a single time? Like buttons, the number of form fields should be reduced to the minimal number possible that can still provide context and ease-of-use.\n\nLimit Cognitive Load: Try to limit the amount information a user needs to understand and retain to complete a task.\n\nLimit Visual Load: Try to limit the amount visual distractions to complete a task.\n\nLimit Kinesthetic Load: Try to limit the amount physical interactions a user needs to complete a task.\n\nAlways Use a Single Colum: The best practice for designing forms is to put inputng fields in a single column. This will make it easier for the end-user to continue their flow down the page and check off each section\n\nThink About the Story You Are Telling: When you think about the story you are telling, look for the best points to break up your forms into multiple pages. Doing so will give you visual space to create breathing room for the end-user and explain to them what they are doing and why it is important.\n\nConsider What Should Go in Drop-Down Menus: If there are only 2–5 form field items to choose from, do not put them in a drop-down menu. This might seem like an elegant solution, but it will not be worth the user’s effort and clicks. Placing radio buttons is a friendlier approach.\n\n\n\nMake the Purpose of Each Button Clear: Consistency in button design is important for enabling the user to progress through your app smoothly\n\nPlan the Position, Color, and Label: The rule of thumb for button design is that, when the end-user moves forward in an app flow, that button should be designed in the following way:\nIt should be on the right\nIt should have the color green\nIt should have a label that explains what it does (for example, “Accept,” “Proceed,” or “Order”)\nFor “destructive tasks,” such as when the end-user wants to cancel a subscription. In this scenario, you would need to consider whether the button label should be “Cancel” or “Cancel subscription.\n\n\n\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/UI/mctc.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UI/mctc.html","title":"Minimal Click To Complete Formula","keywords":"","body":"Minimal Clicks to Complete ( MCTC )\nThis is a concepts of figuring out the minimal clicks on a screen to complete a tasks\nThis calculates the number of users clicks to comeplete task.\nMCTC formula:\nnumber of components + number of screens / number of users events\nExample: ( 2 + 2 ) / 4 = 1\nBest results would be less than 3 clicks to complete tasks.\n"},"docs/TechRole/UI/ui-stages.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UI/ui-stages.html","title":"UI Stages","keywords":"","body":"UI Design Stages\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/UI/Figma/figma.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/UI/Figma/figma.html","title":"Figma","keywords":"","body":"Figma Best Practices\nAccessibility\nEnsuring accessibility is crucial when designing user interfaces.

This helps keep everything related to a specific initiative in one place.\nUse sections and pages: Utilize Figma's sections and pages to break down your work into logical groupings. For example, you could have sections for \"Wireframes\", \"High-Fidelity Designs\", and \"Prototypes\".\nSeparate design systems: If you have a robust design system, consider keeping it in a separate file from your product-specific designs. This makes it easier to maintain and reuse the design system components.\nUse frames for context: Organize your design elements within frames to provide context. For example, you could have frames for \"Homepage\", \"Product Detail Page\", \"Checkout Flow\", etc.\nGroup related elements: Group together related UI elements, such as a header, navigation, and hero section. This helps maintain structure and makes it easier to work with the components.\n\nNaming Conventions\n\nUse clear, descriptive names: Avoid cryptic or abbreviated names. Aim for names that clearly communicate the purpose or content of the file, page, frame, or layer.\nFollow a consistent naming structure: Establish a naming convention and stick to it throughout your Figma files. This could be something like:\nFiles: project-name.fig\nSections: 01-wireframes, 02-high-fidelity, 03-prototypes\nPages: homepage, product-detail, checkout\nFrames: header, hero, footer\nLayers: logo, search-input, cta-button\n\n\nUse sentence case or title case: Choose one capitalization style and apply it consistently. Sentence case (e.g., \"Main navigation\") or title case (e.g., \"Main Navigation\") are both common and acceptable.\nInclude version numbers or dates: If you have multiple iterations of a design, consider including a version number or date in the file name, e.g., homepage-v2.fig or homepage-2023-04-15.fig.\nPrefix shared components: If you have a design system or component library, consider prefixing shared components with a consistent label, such as ds-button, ds-modal, or ds-typography.\n\nTips\n\nKeep names concise: Aim for names that are clear and descriptive, but not overly long.\nUse hyphens or underscores for spaces: Avoid spaces in file, section, or layer names. Use hyphens (-) or underscores (_) instead.\nAutomate naming where possible: Set up naming conventions in your design process and use tools like AutoRenameTool to automatically apply consistent naming.\nDocument your naming conventions: Ensure your team is aware of the agreed-upon naming structure and follows it consistently.\n\nBy following these best practices for Figma file structure and naming, you can keep your design work organized, maintainable, and easy to navigate for yourself and your team.\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/documentation-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/documentation-practices.html","title":"Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Docs Practices\n\nUse a consistent style: Use a consistent writing style and format to make the documentation easier to read and understand.\n\nUse simple and clear language: Use simple and clear language to explain the purpose and functionality of the product or system.

Avoid using technical jargon or overly complex language.\n\nComment for the reader: Write comments with the understanding that someone else may read the code in the future. Make sure that the comments add value to the code and explain what the code is doing.\n\nComment what, not how: Comments should explain what the code is doing, not how it is doing it. The code should be self-explanatory, and comments should clarify any ambiguities or explain the reasoning behind certain decisions.\n\nAvoid redundant comments: Avoid adding comments that are redundant or repeat what is already clear from the code itself. For example, \"this variable stores the user's name\" is unnecessary if the variable is named \"userName\".\n\nUse consistent formatting: Use consistent formatting for comments, such as a consistent margin or indentation. This makes the comments easier to read and understand.\n\nComment edge cases and assumptions: Comment any edge cases or assumptions that are relevant to the code. This can help other developers understand the limitations or conditions under which the code is expected to work.\n\nUpdate comments as needed: Keep comments up-to-date as the code changes. If the code functionality changes, make sure that the comments reflect those changes.\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/security-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/security-practices.html","title":"Security","keywords":"","body":"Security Practices\nSoftware development security best practices that you can follow to improve the security of the software.\n\nSecure coding practices: Follow secure coding practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and access control, to prevent common security vulnerabilities like injection attacks, cross-site scripting, and authentication issues.\n\nUse secure libraries and frameworks: Use well-established libraries and frameworks that have a good track record for security. Keep them updated to ensure that you are using the latest security patches.\n\nPerform regular vulnerability scans and penetration testing: Regularly scan your applications for vulnerabilities and perform penetration testing to identify any weaknesses in your security.\n\nFollow the principle of least privilege: Grant users the least amount of access necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of a compromised user gaining access to sensitive data.\n\nEncrypt sensitive data: Use encryption to protect sensitive data both in transit and at rest.\n\nImplement strong authentication and access controls: Implement strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication, and access controls to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.\n\nKeep software up-to-date: Keep your software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates to address any known vulnerabilities.\n\nEducate your team on security best practices: Educate your team on security best practices to ensure that everyone understands their role in maintaining the security of your software.\n\nHave a security incident response plan: Have a plan in place for responding to security incidents, including identifying the scope of the incident, containing the damage, and mitigating the risk of future incidents.\n\nFollow security regulations and standards: Follow security regulations and standards, such as the OWASP Top 10 and ISO 27001, to ensure that you are implementing industry-standard security practices.\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/github-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/github-practices.html","title":"Github","keywords":"","body":"Github Practices\nBreak down large issues into smaller issues\n\nBreaking a large issue into smaller issues makes the work more manageable and enables team members to work in parallel. It also leads to smaller pull requests, which are easier to review.\n\nTo track how smaller issues fit into the larger goal, use task lists, milestones, or labels. For more information, see \"About tasklists\", \"About milestones\", and \"Managing labels.\"\n\n\nCommunicate\n\nIssues and pull requests include built-in features to let you easily communicate with your collaborators. Use @mentions to alert a person or entire team about a comment. Assign collaborators to issues to communicate responsibility. Link to related issues or pull requests to communicate how they are connected.\n\nMake use of the description and README\n\nUse your project's description and README to share information about the project.\n\nFor example:\n\nExplaining the purpose of the project. Describing the project views and how to use them. Including relevant links and people to contact for more information. Project READMEs support Markdown which allows you to use images and advanced formatting such as links, lists, and headers\n\n\n\nUse views\n\nUse project views to look at your project from different angles.\n\nFor example:\n\nFilter by status to view all un-started items Group by a custom priority field to monitor the volume of high priority items Sort by a custom date field to view the items with the earliest target ship date\n\n\n\nHave a single source of truth\n\nTo prevent information from getting out of sync, maintain a single source of truth. For example, track a target ship date in a single location instead of spread across multiple fields. Then, if the target ship date shifts, you only need to update the date in one location.\n\nProjects automatically stay up to date with GitHub data, such as assignees, milestones, and labels. When one of these fields changes in an issue or pull request, the change is automatically reflected in your project.\n\n\nUse automation\n\nYou can automate tasks to spend less time on busy work and more time on the project itself. The less you need to remember to do manually, the more likely your project will stay up to date.\n\nProjects offers built-in workflows. For example, when an issue is closed, you can automatically set the status to \"Done.\" You can also configure built-in workflows to automatically archive items when they meet certain criteria and to automatically add items from a repository when they match a filter.\n\nAdditionally, GitHub Actions and the GraphQL API enable you to automate routine project management tasks. For example, to keep track of pull requests awaiting review, you can create a workflow that adds a pull request to a project and sets the status to \"needs review\"; this process can be automatically triggered when a pull request is marked as \"ready for review.\"\n\n\nUse different field types\n\nTake advantage of the various field types to meet your needs.\n\nUse an iteration field to schedule work or create a timeline. You can group by iteration to see if items are balanced between iterations, or you can filter to focus on a single iteration. Iteration fields also let you view work that you completed in past iterations, which can help with velocity planning and reflecting on your team's accomplishments. Iteration fields also support breaks to show when you and your team are taking time away from their iterations.\n\nUse a single select field to track information about a task based on a preset list of values. For example, track priority or project phase. Since the values are selected from a preset list, you can easily group or filter to focus on items with a specific value.\n\n\nBest practices for creating and handling pull requests\n\nKeep pull requests small and focused: Each pull request should contain a single feature or bug fix. This makes it easier for reviewers to understand the changes and reduces the risk of conflicts with other changes.\n\nProvide clear and concise descriptions: The pull request description should explain the purpose of the changes, any dependencies or requirements, and any known issues or limitations. This helps reviewers understand the changes and provide feedback more efficiently.\n\nInclude relevant information in the title: The pull request title should summarize the changes and include relevant information, such as the issue number or feature name. This makes it easier to track and manage changes.\n\nTest the changes thoroughly: Before creating a pull request, ensure that the changes have been tested thoroughly and pass all relevant tests. This reduces the risk of introducing bugs or breaking existing functionality.\n\nRespond to feedback promptly: When reviewers provide feedback on the pull request, respond promptly and address the feedback as soon as possible. This helps ensure that the changes are merged quickly and reduces the risk of conflicts with other changes.\n\nKeep the codebase clean: When making changes, ensure that the codebase remains clean and follows best practices, such as using consistent coding conventions, avoiding unnecessary complexity, and keeping code modular and maintainable.\n\nUse branches effectively: Use branches effectively to manage changes and reduce the risk of conflicts. Create separate branches for each feature or bug fix, and merge changes into the main branch as soon as they are tested and approved.\n\n\nBest practices for writing clear and effective commit messages\n\nKeep commit messages concise: Commit messages should be short and to the point, ideally no more than 50 characters. This makes it easier to read and understand changes at a glance.\n\nUse the imperative mood: Use the imperative mood in the subject line of the commit message, as if you were giving a command. For example, \"Fix a bug\" instead of \"Fixed a bug\" or \"Fixes the bug\".\n\nInclude a summary in the subject line: The subject line should provide a summary of the changes made in the commit, and should be written in the present tense. For example, \"Add a new feature\", \"Update documentation\", or \"Fix a typo\".\n\nProvide additional details in the body: Use the body of the commit message to provide additional details about the changes made, including any relevant context or background information. This can help other developers understand the changes more clearly.\n\nUse bullet points to break up the message: If the commit message is long or includes multiple changes, use bullet points to break up the message and make it easier to read.\n\nUse references to related issues or pull requests: If the commit is related to a specific issue or pull request, include a reference to it in the commit message. For example, \"Fix #1234\", where 1234 is the issue number.\n\nUse a consistent style: Use a consistent style for commit messages across your team or organization. This can help make the commit history more readable and easier to understand.\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/a11y-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/a11y-practices.html","title":"A11y","keywords":"","body":"A11y Practices\nWeb Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)\n\nA: Essential: If this isn't met, assistive technology may not be able to read, understand, or fully operate the page or view.\nAA: Ideal Support: Required for multiple government and public body websites.\nAAA: Specialized Support: This is typically reserved for parts of websites and web apps that serve a specialized audience\n\nContent - Content is the most important part of your site.\n\nUse plain language and avoid figures of speech, idioms, and complicated metaphors: Write content at an 8th grade reading level.\nMake sure that button, a, and label element content is unique and descriptive: Terms like “click here” and “read more” do not provide any context. Some people navigate using a list of all buttons or links on a page or view. When using this mode, the terms indicate what will happen if navigated to or activated.\nUse left-aligned text for left-to-right (LTR) languages, and right-aligned text for right-to-left (RTL) languages.\nCentered-aligned or justified text is difficult to read: Valid HTML helps to provide a consistent, expected experience across all browsers and assistive technology.\n\nGlobal code - Global code is code that affects your entire website or web app.\n\nValidate your HTML: Valid HTML helps to provide a consistent, expected experience across all browsers and assistive technology.\nUse a lang attribute on the html element: This helps assistive technology such as screen readers to pronounce content correctly.\nProvide a unique title for each page or view: The title element, contained in the document's head element, is often the first piece of information announced by assistive technology. This helps tell people what page or view they are going to start navigating.\nEnsure that viewport zoom is not disabled: Some people need to increase the size of text to a point where they can read it. Do not stop them from doing this, even for web apps with a native app-like experience. Even native apps should respect Operating System settings for resizing text.\nUse landmark elements to indicate important content regions: Landmark regions help communicate the layout and important areas of a page or view, and can allow quick access to these regions. For example, use the nav element to wrap a site's navigation, and the main element to contain the primary content of a page.\nEnsure a linear content flow: Remove tabindex attribute values that aren't either 0 or -1. Elements that are inherently focusable, such as links or button elements, do not require a tabindex. Elements that are not inherently focusable should not have a tabindex applied to them outside of very specific use cases.\nAvoid using the autofocus attribute: People who are blind or who have low vision may be disoriented when focus is moved without their permission. Additionally, autofocus can be problematic for people with motor control disabilities, as it may create extra work for them to navigate out from the autofocused area and to other locations on the page/view.\nAllow extending session timeouts: If you cannot remove session timeouts altogether, then let the person using your site easily turn off, adjust, or extend their session well before it ends.\nRemove title attribute tooltips: The title attribute has numerous issues, and should not be used if the information provided is important for all people to access. An acceptable use for the title attribute would be labeling an iframe element to indicate what content it contains.\n\nKeyboard - It is important that your interface and content can be operated, and navigated by use of a keyboard.\n\nMake sure there is a visible focus style for interactive elements that are navigated to via keyboard input: Can a person navigating with a keyboard, switch, voice control, or screen reader see where they currently are on the page?\nCheck to see that keyboard focus order matches the visual layout: Can a person navigating with a keyboard or screen reader move around the page in a predictable way?\nRemove invisible focusable elements: Remove the ability to focus on elements that are not presently meant to be discoverable. This includes things like inactive drop down menus, off screen navigations, or modals.\n\nImages\n\nMake sure that all img elements have an alt attribute: alt attributes (alt text) give a description of an image for people who may not be able to view them. When an alt attribute isn't present on an image, a screen reader may announce the image's file name and path instead. This fails to communicate the image’s content.\nMake sure that decorative images use null alt (empty) attribute values: Null alt attributes are also sometimes known as empty alt attributes. They are made by including no information between the opening and closing quotes of an alt attribute. Decorative images do not communicate information that is required to understand the website's overall meaning. Historically they were used for flourishes and spacer gif images, but tend to be less relevant for modern websites and web apps.\nProvide a text alternative for complex images such as charts, graphs, and maps: Is there a plain text which lists points on the map or sections of a flowchart? Describe all visible information. This includes graph axes, data points and labels, and the overall point the graphic is communicating.\nFor images containing text, make sure the alt description includes the image's text: For example, the FedEx logo should have an alt value of “FedEx.”\n\nHeadings - They are incredibly important for helping people who use assistive technology to understand the meaning of a page or view.\n\nUse heading elements to introduce content: Heading elements construct a document outline, and should not be used for purely visual design.\nUse only one h1 element per page or view: The h1 element should be used to communicate the high-level purpose of the page or view. Do not use the h1 element for a heading that does not change between pages or views (for example, the site's name).\nHeading elements should be written in a logical sequence: The order of heading elements should descend, based on the “depth” of the content. For example, a h4 element should not appear on a page before the first h3 element declaration. A tool such as headingsMap can help you evaluate this.\nDon't skip heading levels: For example, don't jump from a h2 to a h4, skipping a h3 element. If heading levels are being skipped for a specific visual treatment, use CSS classes instead.\n\nLists - Lists elements let people know a collection of items are related and if they are sequential, and how many items are present in the list grouping.\n\nUse list elements (ol, ul, and dl elements) for list content: This may include sections of related content, items visually displayed in a grid-like layout, or sibling a elements.\n\nControls - Controls are interactive elements such as links and buttons that let a person navigate to a destination or perform an action\n\nUse the a element for links: Links should always have a href attribute, even when used in Single Page Applications (SPAs). Without a href attribute, the link will not be properly exposed to assistive technology. An example of this would be a link that uses an onclick event, in place of a href attribute.\nEnsure that links are recognizable as links: Color alone is not sufficient to indicate the presence of a link. Underlines are a popular and commonly-understood way to communicate the presence of link content.\nEnsure that controls have focus states: Visible focus styles help people determine which interactive element has keyboard focus. This lets them know that they can perform actions like activating a button or navigating to a link's destination.\nUse the button element for buttons: Buttons are used to submit data or perform an on-screen action which does not shift keyboard focus. You can add type=\"button\" to a button element to prevent the browser from attempting to submit form information when activated.\nProvide a skip link and make sure that it is visible when focused: A skip link can be used to provide quick access to the main content of a page or view. This allows a person to easily bypass globally repeated content such as a website's primary navigation, or persistent search widget.\nIdentify links that open in a new tab or window: Ideally, avoid links that open in a new tab or window. If a link does, ensure the link's behavior will be communicated in a way that is apparent to all users. Doing this will help people understand what will happen before activating the link. While this technique is technically not required for compliance, it is an often-cited area of frustration for many different kinds of assistive technology users.\n\nTables - Tables are a structured set of data that help people understand the relationships between different types of information\n\nUse the table element to describe tabular data: Do you need to display data in rows and columns? Use the table element.\nUse the th element for table headers (with appropriate scope attributes): Depending on how complex your table is, you may also consider using scope=\"col\" for column headers, and scope=\"row\" for row headers. Many different kinds of assistive technology still use the scope attribute to help them understand and describe the structure of a table.\nUse the caption element to provide a title for the table: The table's caption should describe what kind of information the table contains.\n\nForms\n\nAll inputs in a form are associated with a corresponding label element: Use a for/id pairing to guarantee the highest level of browser/assistive technology support.\nUse fieldset and legend elements where appropriate: Does your form contain multiple sections of related inputs? Use fieldset to group them, and legend to provide a label for what this section is for.\nInputs use autocomplete where appropriate: Providing a mechanism to help people more quickly, easily, and accurately fill in form fields that ask for common information (for example, name, address, phone number).\nMake sure that form input errors are displayed in list above the form after submission: This provides a way for assistive technology users to quickly have a high-level understanding of what issues are present in the form. This is especially important for larger forms with many inputs. Make sure that each reported error also has a link to the corresponding field with invalid input.\nAssociate input error messaging with the input it corresponds to: Techniques such as using aria-describedby allow people who use assistive technology to more easily understand the difference between the input and the error message associated with it.\nMake sure that error, warning, and success states are not visually communicated by just color: People who are color blind, who have other low vision conditions, or different cultural understandings for color may not see the state change, or understand what kind of feedback the state represents if color is the only indicator.\n\nMedia\n\nMake sure that media does not autoplay: Unexpected video and audio can be distracting and disruptive, especially for certain kinds of cognitive disability such as ADHD. Certain kinds of autoplaying video and animation can be a trigger for vestibular and seizure disorders.\nEnsure that media controls use appropriate markup: Examples include making sure an audio mute button has a pressed toggle state when active, or that a volume slider uses [input type=\"range\"].\nCheck to see that all media can be paused: Provide a global pause function on any media element. If the device has a keyboard, ensure that pressing the Space key can pause playback. Make sure you also don't interfere with the Space key's ability to scroll the page/view when not focusing on a form control.\n\nVideo\n\nConfirm the presence of captions: Captions allow a person who cannot hear the audio content of a video to still understand its content.\nRemove seizure triggers: Certain kinds of strobing or flashing animations will trigger seizures.\n\nAudio\n\nConfirm that transcripts are available: Transcripts allow people who cannot hear to still understand the audio content. It also allows people to digest audio content at a pace that is comfortable to them.\n\nAppearance - How your website app content looks in any given situation.\n\nCheck your content in specialized browsing modes: Activate modes such as Windows High Contrast or Inverted Colors. Is your content still legible? Are your icons, borders, links, form fields, and other content still present? Can you distinguish foreground content from the background?\nIncrease text size to 200%: Is the content still readable? Does increasing the text size cause content to overlap?\nDouble-check that good proximity between content is maintained: Use the straw test to ensure people who depend on screen zoom software can still easily discover all content.\nMake sure color isn't the only way information is conveyed: Can you still see where links are among body content if everything is grayscale?\nMake sure instructions are not visual or audio-only: Use a combination of characteristics to write cues, particularly the actual names of sections and elements, rather than just descriptions like location (“on the right”) or audio (“after the tone”).\nUse a simple, straightforward, and consistent layout: A complicated layout can be confusing to understand and use.\n\nAnimation\n\nEnsure animations are subtle and do not flash too much: Certain kinds of strobing or flashing animations will trigger seizures. Others may be distracting and disruptive, especially for certain kinds of cognitive disability such as ADHD.\nProvide a mechanism to pause background video: Background video can be distracting, especially if content is placed over it.\nMake sure all animation obeys the prefers-reduced-motion media query: Remove animations when the “reduce motion” setting is activated. If an animation is necessary to communicate meaning for a concept, slow its duration down.\n\nColor contrast Color Contrast\n\nCheck the contrast for all normal-sized text: Level AA compliance requires a contrast ratio of 4.5:1.\nCheck the contrast for all large-sized text: Level AA compliance requires a contrast ratio of 3:1.\nCheck the contrast for all icons: Level AA compliance requires a contrast ratio of 3.0:1.\nCheck the contrast of borders for input elements (text input, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc.): Level AA compliance requires a contrast ratio of 3.0:1.\nCheck text that overlaps images or video: Is text still legible?\nCheck custom ::selection colors: Is the color contrast you set in your ::selection CSS declaration sufficient? Otherwise someone may not be able read it if they highlight it.\n\nMobile and touch\n\nCheck that the site can be rotated to any orientation: Does the site only allow portrait orientation?\nRemove horizontal scrolling: Requiring someone to scroll horizontally can be difficult for some, irritating for all.\nEnsure sufficient space between interactive items in order to provide a scroll area: Some people who experience motor control issues such as hand tremors may have a very difficult time scrolling past interactive items which feature zero spacing.\n\nA11y Tests\n\nA11y Checklist\n\nRun AXE scan\n\nRun Lighthouse scan\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/html-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/html-practices.html","title":"Languages - HTML ","keywords":"","body":"Html Practices\nMDN Html\n\nUse semantic HTML: Use semantic HTML tags to improve the accessibility and SEO of the website.

It involves creating separate tables for each distinct data element and establishing relationships between them using foreign keys. Normalization helps to reduce data redundancy and improve data consistency and integrity.\n\nUse primary and foreign keys: Primary keys are unique identifiers for each row in a table, while foreign keys establish relationships between tables. Use primary keys to ensure that each row in a table is unique, and use foreign keys to create relationships between tables.\n\nIndex your tables: Indexing can greatly improve the performance of database queries by making it easier for the database to find and retrieve data. Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in queries and join operations.\n\nUse constraints to enforce data integrity: Constraints are rules that restrict the values that can be entered into a table. Use constraints to ensure that data is consistent and accurate. Common types of constraints include primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and check constraints.\n\nUse stored procedures and triggers: Stored procedures and triggers are pre-written pieces of code that can be executed by the database in response to specific events. They can be used to automate tasks, enforce business rules, and improve performance.\n\nUse transactions to ensure data consistency: Transactions are groups of database operations that are executed together as a single unit. Use transactions to ensure that data is consistent and accurate even in the event of errors or system failures.\n\nRegularly backup and maintain your database: Backing up your database regularly is essential for ensuring that your data is safe in the event of a system failure or other disaster.

This helps in maintaining a clean and consistent state for the test environment.\n\nUse describe and it functions to organize tests: Use describe and it functions to group and organize your tests. This makes it easier to understand the intent of each test suite and to quickly identify failing tests.\n\nUse mock functions: Use Jest's built-in mocking features to create mock functions for dependencies and external resources. This helps in isolating the code being tested and makes the tests faster and more reliable.\n\nUse snapshot testing: Use Jest's snapshot testing feature to test the output of components and functions. This helps in detecting unexpected changes in the code and ensures that the application output remains consistent.\n\nUse expect assertions: Use Jest's expect assertions to ensure that the expected behavior of the application is achieved. Assertions should be specific and clear, and should not be too generic.\n\nUse coverage reports: Use Jest's coverage reports to analyze the code coverage of your tests. This helps in identifying areas of your code that are not being tested adequately.\n\nUse test matchers: Use Jest's built-in test matchers to create tests that match specific conditions or behaviors. This helps in creating more targeted and focused tests.\n\nUse environment variables: Use environment variables to manage sensitive data or configurations that are specific to the test environment. This helps in keeping the code clean and portable.\n\nUse Jest configuration files: Use Jest configuration files to customize the behavior of the testing framework. This helps in creating a consistent and reliable testing environment, and allows for easy integration with other tools and systems.\n\n\nSetup your test suite in a separate file: Use your jest.config.js file to set up globals and shared code for your test suite. When you start out, you will likely come across code that needs to be shared across different test files. For this, you want to set up a global configuration file.\n\n\n\n{\n    ...\n    setupFilesAfterEnv: ['/setup-jest.js']\n    // jest.config.js - rootDir references the root of your project's directory\n}\n\n\n\nUse one test file per component: Make sure you separate and you only include one component/class/module per test file. You want to separate different tests into different files to make them well separated, keep the files slim, and make them easily maintainable.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\n-components.test.js -\n  // ✔️ Do\n  Accordion.test.js -\n  Button.test.js -\n  Icon.test.js;\n\n\n\nOrganize your tests with describe and test/it: Inside each of your test files, organize your test steps into describe and test/it blocks.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\nit('Test accordion', () => { .. })\nit('Test buttons and icons', () => { .. })\n\n// ✔️ Do\ndescribe('Accordion', () => {\n    it('Should open and close on click', () => { ... })\n    it('Should be able to set the default state', () => { ... })\n})\n\ndescribe('Button', () => {\n    it('Should be able to pass a callback function', () => { ... })\n    it('Should be able to set to secondary and tertiary', () => { ... })\n})\n\n\n4.a Setup and reset commons in beforeEach/afterEach hooks: Use beforeEach and afterEach hook to set up common code for test cases, and reset all mocks after your tests. Luckily, Jest comes with a couple of setup hooks that you can use to separate common functionality out of your test cases.\n\n// Setup common mocks or function calls in the following hooks\ndescribe('Before and after hooks', () => {\n  beforeAll(() => setupOnce());\n  beforeEach(() => setupEach());\n  afterAll(() => resetOnce());\n  afterEach(() => resetEach());\n});\n\n\n4.b There are four different hooks in Jest that can be used for repeating or one-time setups. These are beforeAll, beforeEach, afterAll, and afterEach. The before hooks are usually used for setups, while the after hooks are used for clean-ups. They work similarly, but they are executed differently.\n\nbeforeAll: Executes code before all tests once. beforeEach: Executes code before each test. afterAll: Executes code after all tests once. afterEach: Executes code after each test.\ndescribe('How before and after hooks work', () => {\n    // Executes once before the two it blocks\n    beforeAll(() => { ... })\n\n    // Executes before the 1st it block, then executes a second time before the 2nd block\n    beforeEach(() => { ... })\n\n    it('1st it block', () => { ... })\n    it('2nd it block', () => { ... })\n\n    // Executes once after the two it blocks\n    afterAll(() => { ... })\n\n    // Executes after the 1st it block, then executes a second time after the 2nd block\n    afterEach(() => { ... })\n})\n\n\n5.a Also test what should not happen: When writing tests, a common practice is to test what a function should do, or a component should render. But you not only want to test the obvious but also edge cases and negative cases. What should not happen? What should not be returned from a function, or what should not be rendered by a component?\n\n// ❌ Don't\ndescribe('Answer', () => {\n  it('should render correctly', () => {\n    render(42);\n    expect('42').toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n\n// ✔️ Do\ndescribe('Answer', () => {\n  it('Should render correctly', () => {\n    render(42);\n    expect('42').not.toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n\n  it('Should not render when hidden is set to true', () => {\n    render(42);\n    expect('42').not.toBeInTheDocument();\n  });\n});\n\n\n5.b In the above example, we are testing a component that can be hidden given if a certain prop is defined. We also want to test for this case. Or if your component conditionally renders data, you want to test what happens if the data is not rendered. The same goes for functions. Don't only test positive, but negative paths as well.\n\n// ❌ Don't\ndescribe('Validating email addresses', () => {\n  it('Should validate email addresses', () => {\n    expect(validateEmail('email@email.com')).toBe(true);\n    expect(validateEmail('john@doe.net')).toBe(true);\n  });\n});\n\n// ✔️ Do\ndescribe('Validating email addresses', () => {\n  it('Should validate email addresses', () => {\n    expect(validateEmail('email@email.com')).toBe(true);\n    expect(validateEmail('john@doe.net')).toBe(true);\n\n    expect(validateEmail('email')).toBe(false);\n    expect(validateEmail('email@')).toBe(false);\n    expect(validateEmail('email@email')).toBe(false);\n  });\n});\n\n\n\nMake your tests deterministic: Each test case should be independent of the other and should be able to pass on its own.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\ndescribe('Filtering', () => {\n    it('Should open up accordion', () => { ... })\n    it('Should check best tutorials', () => { ... })\n    it('Should filter for best tutorials', () => { ... })\n})\n\n// ✔️ Do\ndescribe('Filtering', () => {\n    // Mock everything else that is required for the interaction\n    it('Should filter for best tutorials', () => { ... })\n})\n\n\n\nDon’t rely on network calls: Being deterministic means you can't rely on network calls. You not only want to ensure that your tests don't depend on each other, but you also want to ensure that your tests are completely isolated from other factors too. This includes:\n\n\nNo network calls are being made\n\nThere are no dependencies on API calls\nThere are no dependencies on environment variables\nThere are no dependencies on external dependencies\n\nThis means if you need to test any functionality that heavily relies on one of the above, you first need to mock the dependency and ensure that their output is always consistent.\nbeforeAll(() => {\n    const useStaticQuery = jest.spyOn(Gatsby, 'useStaticQuery')\n\n    // Mocking implementation to ensure consistent outcomes\n    useStaticQuery.mockImplementation(() => { ... })\n})\n\n\n\nDon’t duplicate implementation logic: You should rather have duplicated code in your test suite than logic that makes your tests behave differently, given different inputs. Always test the outcomes, not the implementation.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\nit('Should return the sum of numbers below 10', () => {\n  for (let i = 0; i  {\n  expect(sum[(1, 2, 3)]).toBe(6);\n  expect(sum[(3, 3)]).toBe(9);\n  expect(sum[(4, 6)]).not.toBe(10);\n});\n\n\n\nDon’t test implementation logic: You also don't want to test implementation logic. Whenever you write your unit tests, you care about the outcomes and that the correct values are produced. You care about what is happening, not about how it is happening. Implementations can often change without actually affecting the outcome.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\nit('Should call reduce on the array', () => { ... })\n\n// ✔️ Do\nit('Should return the sum of values', () => { ... })\n\nImagine that the implementation you are testing is getting refactored. You want your test suite to be a safety net that can give you confidence in making changes in your code base without breaking anything, not a burden that you have to update for every little change.\n\n\nRun your tests as part of your deployment: Run your test suite before each deployment to ensure you didn't accidentally break any functionality. Preferably, you also want to run your unit tests on each pull request to ensure that changes don't break your existing tests.\n\n\n\nPatch bugs: Whenever you discover a bug, it is a good practice to patch it with a quick unit test to avoid regressions. That way, you can ensure that these bugs will never return again.\n\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/Testing/cypress-practices.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/Testing/cypress-practices.html","title":"Cypress","keywords":"","body":"Cypress Practices\nCypress Docs\n\nWrite clean and maintainable code: Write clear, concise, and modular code that is easy to read, understand, and maintain. Use descriptive and meaningful names for your tests and test components.\n\nUse Cypress commands instead of traditional DOM queries: Cypress provides a rich set of commands to interact with web elements, which is much easier to use and provides better error handling than traditional DOM queries.\n\nUse fixtures for data: Use fixtures to store test data instead of hardcoding data in the test scripts. This helps in making the test data easily maintainable and reusable.\n\nUse custom commands: Create custom commands to encapsulate commonly used functionality or interactions with your application. This reduces code duplication and increases maintainability.\n\nUse aliases: Use aliases to store references to web elements and then reuse them across multiple tests. This reduces the time required to search for the same element again and again.\n\nUse timeouts effectively: Set appropriate timeouts for Cypress commands to avoid unnecessary delays in the test execution. It is important to set an appropriate timeout for each command to ensure that the test runs smoothly.\n\nUse proper assertions: Use proper assertions to ensure that the expected behavior of the application is achieved. Assertions should be specific and clear, and should not be too generic.\n\nUse Cypress Studio for visual testing: Use Cypress Studio to visually record and replay tests. This helps in creating tests quickly and also makes it easy to update them when the application changes.\n\nUse beforeEach and afterEach hooks: Use beforeEach and afterEach hooks to perform setup and cleanup actions before and after each test. This helps in maintaining a clean and consistent state for the test environment.\n\nUse Cypress Dashboard for test reporting: Use Cypress Dashboard to monitor test results and analyze trends. This helps in identifying issues and taking corrective actions quickly.\n\n\nUse data Attributes When Selecting Elements: You want to create selectors that can be specifically targeted for testing purposes so that no CSS or JavaScript update can break your test suite, just because a selector has been changed. The best option here is to use custom data attributes. Avoid using class names, ids, tags, or common attribute selectors. Use custom data selectors to isolate your test from your CSS and JS.\n\n\n\n// ✅ Do\ncy.get('[data-cy=\"link\"]');\ncy.get('[data-test-id=\"link\"]');\n\n// ❌ Don't\ncy.get('button'); // Too generic\ncy.get('.button'); // Coupled with CSS\ncy.get('#button'); // Coupled with JS\ncy.get('[type=\"submit\"]'); // Coupled with HTML\n\n\n\nSet a Base Url: Setting a base URL globally is also a great practice. It can not only make your tests cleaner, it also makes it easier to switch the test suite between different environments, such as a localhost and a production site. Set a base URL to avoid unnecessary reloads and easily switch between different environments.\n-\n\n\n\n// ✅ Do set a base URL in your cypress.json config\ncy.visit('webtips/cypress');\n\n// ❌ Don't\ncy.visit('https://webtips.dev/webtips/cypress');\ncy.visit('http://localhost/webtips/cypress');\n\n\n\nAvoid Using cy.wait with a Number: The problem with this is that you end up waiting more than necessary. If you use cy.wait with 5000 milliseconds to wait for a network request, but the request finishes in 500 milliseconds, then you increased the run time of your test suite by 4500 milliseconds for no reason. Instead, use cy.wait with an alias to ensure that the condition you are waiting on is met, so you can proceed safely. You can also use assertions in place of cy.wait to ensure that certain conditions are met before moving on. Only use cy.wait with an alias to avoid waiting more than necessary.\n\n\n\n// ✅ Do\ncy.intercept('POST', '/login').as('login');\ncy.wait('@login'); // Waiting for the request explicitly\n\n// ❌ Don't\ncy.wait(5000);\n\n\n\nTests Should be Able to Pass Independently: Relying on the state of a previous test leads to a brittle test suite that can break the rest of your test cases if initial conditions are not met. Decouple your tests and either combine multiple steps that rely on each other into one, or create shared code that you can reuse.\n\n\n\n// ❌ Don't\nit('Should log the user in', () => { ... });\nit('Should be able to change settings', () => {\n    cy.get('[data-cy=\"email\"]').type('email@updated.com');\n});\n\nit('Should show updated settings', () => {\n    cy.contains('[data-cy=\"profile\"]', 'email@updated.com');\n});\n\n\n\nControl State Programmatically: Whenever you need to set the state for your application so you can test under the right conditions, always try to set the state programmatically, rather than using the UI. This means your state will be decoupled from the UI. You will also see a performance improvement, as setting the state programmatically is faster than using the UI of your application. we can use cy.request to directly communicate with an API to log a user in, rather than using the UI to do the same. The same applies to other actions, such as adding test data for your application to get it into the right state.\n\n\n\n// ✅ Do\ncy.request('POST', '/login', {\n  email: 'test@email.com',\n  pass: 'testPass',\n});\n\n// ❌ Don't\ncy.get('[data-cy=\"email\"]').type('test@email.com');\ncy.get('[data-cy=\"pass\"]').type('test@email.com');\ncy.get('[data-cy=\"submit\"]').click();\n\n\n\nAvoid Single Assertions: Avoid using single assertions, to prevent unnecessary state resets that affects performance.\n\n\n\n// ✅ Do\nit('Should have an external link pointing to the right domain', () => {\n    cy.get('.link')\n      .should('have.length', 1)\n      .find('a')\n      .should('contain', 'webtips.dev');\n      .and('have.attr', 'target', '_blank');\n});\n\n// ❌ Don't\nit('Should have a link', () => {\n    cy.get('.link')\n      .should('have.length', 1)\n      .find('a');\n});\n\nit('Should contain the right text', () => {\n    cy.get('.link').find('a').should('contain', 'webtips.dev');\n});\n\nit('Should be external', () => {\n    cy.get('.link').find('a').should('have.attr', 'target', '_blank');\n});\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/File-Structures/vanilla.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/File-Structures/vanilla.html","title":"File Structure - Vanilla","keywords":"","body":"Vanilla App Practice: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript\nproject\n├── index.html\n├── css\n│   └── style.css\n├── assets\n│   ├── images\n│   ├── fonts\n│   └── other_assets\n└── js\n    └── script.js-\n\n\nproject: This is still the root folder of your project.\n\nindex.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point of your web application.\n\ncss: The folder for CSS files.\n\nstyle.css: The CSS file(s) that define the styles and layout. assets: This folder is introduced to contain various assets used in your project.\n\n\nassets: You can place your image files, custom fonts, and other assets in their respective subfolders within the assets folder.\n\nimages: A subfolder to store image files.\n\nfonts: A subfolder to store custom font files.\n\nother_assets: A subfolder to store any additional assets like audio, video, or documents.\n\n\n\njs: The folder for JavaScript files.\n\nscript.js: The JavaScript file(s) that provide interactivity and dynamic functionality.\n\n\n\n"},"docs/TechRole/Development/File-Structures/next-typescript.html":{"url":"docs/TechRole/Development/File-Structures/next-typescript.html","title":"File Structure - Nextjs","keywords":"","body":"Next.js App Practice:\n- pages/\n  - index.tsx\n  - about.tsx\n  - ...\n- components/\n  - Header.tsx\n  - Footer.tsx\n  - ...\n- layouts/\n  - MainLayout.tsx\n  - ...\n- api/\n  - users.ts\n  - products.ts\n  - ...\n- utils/\n  - apiUtils.ts\n  - dateUtils.ts\n  - ...\n- styles/\n  - globalStyles.css\n  - ...\n- public/\n  - images/\n    - logo.png\n    - ...\n  - fonts/\n    - ...\n- types/\n  - types.ts\n  - interfaces.ts\n  - ...\n- ...\n\nFile Breakdown\n\npages: Contains the individual pages or routes of your application.
