# Figma File Structure and Naming Best Practices

## File Structure
- **Organize by project or product**: Create a main file for each project or product you're working on. This helps keep everything related to a specific initiative in one place.
- **Use sections and pages**: Utilize Figma's sections and pages to break down your work into logical groupings. For example, you could have sections for "Wireframes", "High-Fidelity Designs", and "Prototypes".
- **Separate design systems**: If you have a robust design system, consider keeping it in a separate file from your product-specific designs. This makes it easier to maintain and reuse the design system components.
- **Use frames for context**: Organize your design elements within frames to provide context. For example, you could have frames for "Homepage", "Product Detail Page", "Checkout Flow", etc.
- **Group related elements**: Group together related UI elements, such as a header, navigation, and hero section. This helps maintain structure and makes it easier to work with the components.

## Naming Conventions
- **Use clear, descriptive names**: Avoid cryptic or abbreviated names. Aim for names that clearly communicate the purpose or content of the file, page, frame, or layer.
- **Follow a consistent naming structure**: Establish a naming convention and stick to it throughout your Figma files. This could be something like:
  - Files: `project-name.fig`
  - Sections: `01-wireframes`, `02-high-fidelity`, `03-prototypes`
  - Pages: `homepage`, `product-detail`, `checkout`
  - Frames: `header`, `hero`, `footer`
  - Layers: `logo`, `search-input`, `cta-button`
- **Use sentence case or title case**: Choose one capitalization style and apply it consistently. Sentence case (e.g., "Main navigation") or title case (e.g., "Main Navigation") are both common and acceptable.
- **Include version numbers or dates**: If you have multiple iterations of a design, consider including a version number or date in the file name, e.g., `homepage-v2.fig` or `homepage-2023-04-15.fig`.
- **Prefix shared components**: If you have a design system or component library, consider prefixing shared components with a consistent label, such as `ds-button`, `ds-modal`, or `ds-typography`.

## Tips
- **Keep names concise**: Aim for names that are clear and descriptive, but not overly long.
- **Use hyphens or underscores for spaces**: Avoid spaces in file, section, or layer names. Use hyphens (`-`) or underscores (`_`) instead.
- **Automate naming where possible**: Set up naming conventions in your design process and use tools like AutoRenameTool to automatically apply consistent naming.
- **Document your naming conventions**: Ensure your team is aware of the agreed-upon naming structure and follows it consistently.

By following these best practices for Figma file structure and naming, you can keep your design work organized, maintainable, and easy to navigate for yourself and your team.
