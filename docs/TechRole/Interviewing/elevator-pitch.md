## Elevator Pitch

I design and build digital experiences that make websites easy, fast, and fun to use. My job is to make sure that everything looks good, works smoothly, and is simple for users to navigate, so they keep coming back. I blend strategy, research, design with tech to create seamless online journeys, helping brands connect better with people.
